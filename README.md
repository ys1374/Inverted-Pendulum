The importance of automatic control in industries and everyday life is undeniable, and it can be said that 
automatic control systems are among the most important parts of today's advanced industries. In this 
project, we will pose a question and use tools such as dynamics and control science to find a satisfactory 
answer. Although this question has been repeatedly addressed in the field of control science and has 
received satisfactory answers, the nature of science and scientific methods is reproducibility. We aim to 
reproduce an answer to this issue in both theoretical and practical states. The question is: 
"How can the relative angle of a satellite carrier to the ground be controlled?" 
The need to pose such a question arises when you want to actively control the satellite carrier's angle 
relative to the ground to eliminate the effects of unmeasurable and unpredictable external factors such 
as wind or gravity. This can be done in two ways: one is using side fins, which will consume a lot of fuel 
since satellite carriers usually have to move at angles other than 90 degrees to the ground. Weight is 
always a critical factor for the satellite carrier's range. The other method is thrust vector control, which 
is the method examined in this project. In this project, we first define the satellite carrier model and 
derive the equations describing the satellite carrier's motion, then we use control science to control the 
main variable, i.e., the satellite carrier's angle relative to the ground.
